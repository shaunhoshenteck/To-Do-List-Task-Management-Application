• Designed a fully functional command-line task management application in Java with basic Model View Controller architecture.
• Allows users to create and organize their 'to-do' lists.
• Implemented a command-line parser to determine what the client wants and allows flexibility in how the 'to-do' list is generated.
• Used a Builder pattern to create 'to-do' objects.
• Implemented efficient sorting and filtering methodologies for the 'to-do' list using knowledge of lambda functions.
• Performed code reviews and exchanged information with teammates through Git.
